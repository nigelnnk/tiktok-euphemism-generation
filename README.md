# Environments

## Masked Language Modelling
Refer to `mlm_environment.yml`. This method mainly relies on huggingface's transformers library. 

## KNN Embedding
This uses a depreciated library `bert-embeddings`. Thus, it would be difficult to set up using conda. A reproducible environment would be to use python=3.7 and then run `pip install bert-embeddings`. 


# Notable Files

## euphemism_generation\BERT K-NN Search\100000_VERSION_BERT_KNN_Search.ipynb
This jupyter notebook has been used to easily explore/test our method through google colab. It will output the top_10_100000_corpus.json file.

## euphemism_evaluation\analysis.ipynb
This jupyter notebook has been used to analyze the euphemisms generated by the baselines

## euphemism_evaluation\euphemism-analysis.ipynb
This jupyter notebook has been used to analyze the euphemisms generated by the ConSim. It also has been used to scrape videos for good euphemistic hashtags for each of the examined euphemism generation method.
