# Environments

## Masked Language Modelling
Refer to `mlm_environment.yml`. This method mainly relies on huggingface's transformers library. 

## KNN Embedding
This uses a depreciated library `bert-embeddings`. Thus, it would be difficult to set up using conda. A reproducible environment would be to use python=3.7 and then run `pip install bert-embeddings`.
